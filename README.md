# Todo
## Backend Tasks




### In Progress(check for done)
- [ ] create a instructions constant to the API from a outside file
- [ ] create a API parametrs file to interact with the python script from outside
- [x] make the approve logic striaght from the first page bottun

### Component algo
- [ ] create a interactive dataset of a component store with available parts with pricing
- [ ] get a BOM/component list of the component from the project
- [ ] search in the component store for pricing and avability, get total pricing for project components
- [ ] interact with store to order with BOM file (automatically  whan trusted)
- [ ] if using a microcontroller a script from API is needed 
### In Progress(check for done)
s


### Codes algo
- [ ] set a instruction for the API to generate optimized code
- [ ] run with a feedback loop the code for autocorrection of errors 
- [ ] (if possible packege/scripting) run microcontroller code in python simulation and feedback the results
- [ ] check for progrematicaly interact with KICAD by bash with the python area in the program
- [ ] seperate python PCB generator from code. make it dynamic for chnages in packege
